# Superstore-Profit-Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts profit for a US Superstore using advanced regression techniques (LightGBM), with a strong focus on feature engineering, data cleaning, and model validation.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Dataset: US Superstore (Sales, Profit, Discounts, Categories, Shipping, etc.)
- Techniques Used: EDA, Feature Engineering, LightGBM, Cross-Validation
- R² Score (Cross-Validated): **0.81**
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LightGBM

## 📁 Structure
- `notebook/`: Jupyter Notebook for EDA + modeling
- `data/`: Cleaned dataset
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries used

## 📊 Key Learnings
- Importance of avoiding data leakage
- Impact of interaction and aggregate features
- Regression model tuning using cross-validation
